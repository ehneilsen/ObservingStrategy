\section{Gravitational Waves Standard Sirens}
\def\secname{lenstimedelays}\label{sec:\secname}

Gravitational waves from coalescing binary neutron stars and  
black holes provide a direct measurement of the 
distance to those systems, bypassing the distance ladder and 
avoiding its systematics. 
If their host galaxies can be identified, a measurement of Cosmological 
parameters can be obtained using the distance-redshift relation. 
LSST is an ideal instrument to identify hosts for a large number of  
GW sources.

\subsection{Target measurements and discoveries}
\label{sec:\secname:targets}


Standard sirens have long been proposed as a possible new method to meet the challenge of 
measuring the cosmic expansion history without being limited by systematic uncertainties 
typically associated with standard candles. Recent observations of gravitational wave
emission from mergers of compact objects have enabled us to begin exploring this possibility
from the experimental perspective. 

Gravitational wave signal provides absolute measurement of the distance to 
the merging systems. Redshift information is required to construct a Hubble diagram 
from which cosmological parameters can be measured. Such information requires the 
identification of EM counterparts to the GW events. Associated challenges are
described in section \ref{sec:??} which shows that although the Baseline Cadence 
\opsimdbref{db:baseCadence} performs poorly, a low-impact ToO program can let us take 
advantage of LSST's unique capability for this science. 

In this section, we use the MAF to evaluate the Baseline and Rolling cadences
for this use for cosmology and propose a ToO component. 

% --------------------------------------------------------------------

\subsection{Metrics}
\label{sec:\secname:metrics}

%f1. Number of detections (area covered)

%f2. Detection efficiency 

%number of GW events * f1 * f2 = number of points in the hubble diagram > 10


For a 3\% measurement error on $H_0$, we require about 25 standard sirens 
with an identified optical counterpart \cite{13095382}.
Assuming a number $N$ of GW events per year, we can calculate the 
efficiency $e$ needed in order to have our program achieve that measurement error 
within a time $T$ of operations. 

$$N \times e \times T > 25$$

The efficiency has two components, one is the probability $p_A$ that LSST has imaged 
the volume element in which the event happened within a time delta t from the trigger. 
The second component is the probability of detection $p_d$ of the source if the observation 
occurs. 

$$ e = p_A \times p_d > \frac{25}{N \times T}$$

We therefore will employ the MAF framework to evaluate $p_A$ and $p_d$ for each scenario.

The area probability is computed by averaging the probability covered for each simulated
event. We consider $N=50$ simulated events in $T=1$ year of operations. 
We approximate the event area maps as 2D Gaussians with width $\sigma= 5$ degrees.  
(https://github.com/soares-santos/gwMetrics/blob/master/metrics.py)

The detection probability is computed using SNANA framework, similar to what is 
Zoheyr's paper. 

Parameters of ToO program:
- Max number of interruptions per month/week
- Max amount of time dedicated to ToOs total
- Bands 
- Depth 
- Number of revisits
- Cadence of revisits

We select to test two ToO options:
- ToO full program
- ToO discovery only

%% All three of these diagnostic metrics would, in an ideal world, be
%% optimized: this could be achieved by decreasing the night-to-night
%% cadence (to better sample the light curves), extending the observing
%% season length (to maximize the chances of capturing a strong variation
%% and its echo), and extending the campaign length (to increase the number
%% of effective time delay measurements).

%% The quantity of greatest scientific interest is the {\it accuracy in
%% cosmological parameters}: this could be computed as follows. Setting a
%% required accuracy threshold  defines the available number of lenses,
%% which in turns gives us the mean precision per lens there. Combining the
%% whole sample, we would get the error on the weighted mean time delay, as
%% used by \citet{Coe+Moustakas2009}. This uncertainty, which scales as one
%% over the square root of the number of available lenses,  can be roughly
%% equated to the statistical uncertainty on the Hubble constant. The
%% Figure of Merit would be the final percentage precision on $H_0$, as a
%% way to sum up the sample size and time delay measurability (at fixed
%% accuracy requirement).

\subsection{\OpSim Analysis}
\label{sec:\secname:analysis}

% \OpSim analysis: how good would the default observing strategy be, at
% the time of writing for this science project?

%% In this section we present the results of our ongoing \OpSim / MAF
%% analysis, as we start to try to
%% answer the question ``how good would the proposed observing
%% strategies be, for time delay lens cosmography?''

%% \autoref{fig:lenstimedelays:accuracymaps} shows maps of TDC2 time delay
%% measurement accuracy from our MAF analysis of two \OpSim databases, the
%% baseline cadence \opsimdbref{db:baseCadence}, and a ``No Visit Pairs''
%% strategy, \opsimdbref{db:NoVisitPairs}. We compare three different
%% analysis scenarios, differing by a) whether or not we can combine all 6
%% filters' light curves such that they behave like the TDC2 single-filter
%% simulations (as was assumed by \citeauthor{LiaoEtal2015}), and b)
%% whether we wait 5 or 10 years before making the time delay measurement.\footnote{Here, ``years'' means ``seasons:'' we used the
%% \simsMAFcontrib{SeasonStacker}{mafContrib/seasonStacker.py} to work
%% with seasons, rather than calendar years.}

%% These sky maps saturate at a threshold of 0.04\%, chosen conservatively
%% to be 5 times stricter than that used by
%% \citeauthor{Hojjati+Linder2014}. We can see that the area of sky
%% providing lenses measurable at this accuracy or better increases
%% markedly as we move from $ri$ to $ugrizy$. These maps predict that while
%% the accuracy should increase between DR5 and DR10, the sky area yielding
%% accuracy better than 0.04\% should already be close to the full WFD area
%% (18000 square degrees) by DR5: this bodes well for our ability to make
%% use of shorter campaign sky areas observed at higher frequency, as would
%% emerge from a rolling cadence strategy.

%% To summarize the diagnostic metric results, we first compute the area of
%% this ``high accuracy'' sky. We can then compute the cadence, season, and
%% campaign length just in these areas; these values are reported in
%% \autoref{tab:lenstimedelays:results}. The high accuracy area can be used
%% to define a ``Gold Sample'' of lenses, whose mean precision per lens we
%% can compute. The TDC2 useable fraction averaged over this area gives us
%% the approximate size of this sample: we simply re-scale the 400 lenses
%% predicted by \citet{LiaoEtal2015} by this fraction over the 30\% found
%% in TDC2. While these numbers are approximate, the ratios between
%% different observing and analysis strategies provide a useful indication of relative merit.

%% As described above, we follow \citet{Coe+Moustakas2009} and compute a
%% very simple time delay distance Figure of Merit ``\texttt{DPrecision}''
%% as follows. We first combine the fractional time delay precision in
%% quadrature with an assumed 4\% ``modeling uncertainty,'' and then divide
%% this by the square root of the number of Gold Sample lenses. This
%% estimated ensemble distance precision can be straightforwardly related
%% to cosmological parameter precision, as \citet{Coe+Moustakas2009} show
%% (it's very roughly the precision on the Hubble constant).  This distance
%% precision Figure of Merit is given in the final column of
%% \autoref{tab:lenstimedelays:results}. We see that in DR5, being able to
%% combine all filters instead of just $ri$ should give a FoM of 0.29\%
%% instead of 1.25\%; between DR5 and DR10 this then should improve to
%% 0.24. This suggests that time delay measurement is primarily {\it
%% analysis-limited}. In the ``No Visit Pairs'' strategy, we seet that the
%% DR5 all-band FoM is 0.26\%, just a 10\% improvement. This might be
%% because the ``No Visit Pairs'' does not {\it insist} that the visits in
%% the visit pairs are split over different nights, only that they don't
%% {\it have} to be taken on the same night. We might expect a more
%% aggressive approach to splitting visit pairs to make a bigger difference --
%% but it seems unlikely that it would be a factor of two improvement.

\subsection{Discussion}
\label{sec:\secname:discussion}

%% The main risk involved with this science case is that the
%% ``multi-filter'' light curve analysis presented here, which extrapolates
%% from the results of the single-filter TDC1, does not represent
%% accurately the real-life combination of all 6 filters together. The
%% second time delay challenge (TDC2) will help answer this question.  For
%% now, just using 2 filters gives an upper limit on the overall precision
%% we should expect.

%% Naively, we would expect the relaxation of the visit pairs requirement
%% to increase the  night-to-night cadence by a factor of two, if the
%% visits are redistributed randomly in time. However, it seems \OpSim is
%% not as liberal as this, such that we do not see much improvement over
%% the baseline cadence. Efficiency maximization could be preventing visits
%% being fully split. We are interested in any changes to the WFD survey
%% time sampling that reduce the inter-night gaps: these  would include
%% rolling cadence schemes.


% ====================================================================

\subsection{Conclusions}

Based on the above results, we now answer the ten questions posed in
\autoref{sec:intro:evaluation:caseConclusions}:

\begin{description}

\item[Q1:] {\it Does the science case place any constraints on the
tradeoff between the sky coverage and coadded depth? For example, should
the sky coverage be maximized (to $\sim$30,000 deg$^2$, as e.g., in
Pan-STARRS) or the number of detected galaxies (the current baseline but
with 18,000 deg$^2$)?}

%% \item[A1:] Yes: it's probably better to have smaller area and better
%% data, especially if the multi-filter light curve analysis turns out to
%% be difficult. This conclusion is partly informed by the apparently small
%% difference between 5 years and 10 years campaign length, although we
%% need to be careful: COSMOGRAIL studies show that the longer monitoring
%% campaigns yield significantly higher accuracy results.

\item[Q2:] {\it Does the science case place any constraints on the
tradeoff between uniformity of sampling and frequency of sampling? For
example, a rolling cadence can provide enhanced sample rates over a part
of the survey or the entire survey for a designated time at the cost of
reduced sample rate the rest of the time (while maintaining the nominal
total visit counts).}

%% \item[A2:] Yes: higher frequency is better, up to the point where the
%% visit separation becomes less than one night. We would like to see the
%% additional visits gained through rolling cadence used to fill in the
%% nights in the campaign rather than going deeper by taking more visits
%% per night.

\item[Q3:] {\it Does the science case place any constraints on the
tradeoff between the single-visit depth and the number of visits
(especially in the $u$-band where longer exposures would minimize the
impact of the readout noise)?}

%% \item[A3:] Yes: we have not investigated this in detail, but it's very
%% likely that we'd prefer more shallow visits than fewer deeper visits.

\item[Q4:] {\it Does the science case place any constraints on the
Galactic plane coverage (spatial coverage, temporal sampling, visits per
band)?}

%% \item[A4:] No: only inasmuch that time spent in the plane could have
%% been used to improve the night-to-nght sampling frequency. The effect is
%% probably not large.

\item[Q5:] {\it Does the science case place any constraints on the
fraction of observing time allocated to each band?}

%% \item[A5:] Yes, but: in principle an all $i$-band survey would make time
%% delay estimation easier. However, since we need the other filters to
%% assist with lens finding and lens environment characterization, we'd be
%% reluctant to advocate any move away from the universal $ugrizy$
%% coverage.

\item[Q6:] {\it Does the science case place any constraints on the
cadence for deep drilling fields?}

%\item[A6:] To first order, no.

\item[Q7:] {\it Assuming two visits per night, would the science case
benefit if they are obtained in the same band or not?}

%\item[A7:] Yes, probably: different bands are probably going to be
%better, but this has not been tested. It would clearly provide good
%information on the AGN color variability model.

\item[Q8:] {\it Will the case science benefit from a special cadence
prescription during commissioning or early in the survey, such as:
acquiring a full 10-year count of visits for a small area (either in all
the bands or in a  selected set); a greatly enhanced cadence for a small
area?}

%% \item[A8:] Not really. We rely on the difference imaging working well,
%% so making a good template across as much sky as possible would be good.
%% Including a known lens system (from DES, perhaps) in any deep field
%% would be useful too: we'd be happy if the cadence to be similar to WDF
%% to be able to test our software.

\item[Q9:] {\it Does the science case place any constraints on the
sampling of observing conditions (e.g., seeing, dark sky, airmass),
possibly as a function of band, etc.?}

%\item[A9:] No.

\item[Q10:] {\it Does the case have science drivers that would require
real-time exposure time optimization to obtain nearly constant
single-visit limiting depth?}

%\item[A10:] No.
